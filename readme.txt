Enhance.isInterstitialReady(callback);

    resultCallback,
    placement = 'default'
)

Check if an interstitial ad from any of the included SDK providers is ready to be shown.

Returns true to callback if any ad is ready, false otherwise.


void Enhance.showInterstitialAd(
    placement = 'default'
)

Rewarded Ads are usually full-screen video ads which users can view to receive a reward inside the application, like an additional in-game currency or a health bonus.

var callback = function(result) {
    if(!result) {
        app.writeLog('Rewarded ad is not ready');

    // The ad is ready
    var onRewardGranted = function(rewardValue, rewardType) {
        if(rewardType == Enhance.RewardType.ITEM) 
            app.writeLog("Reward granted (item)");

        else if(rewardType == Enhance.RewardType.COINS)
            app.writeLog("Reward granted (coins), value: " + rewardValue);
    };

    var onRewardDeclined = function() {
        app.writeLog('Reward declined');
    };

    var onRewardUnavailable = function() {
        app.writeLog('Reward unavailable');
    };

Offer Walls
-----------

Example usage:

    if(!result) {
        app.writeLog('Offerwall is not ready');
        return;
    }

    Enhance.setReceivedCurrencyCallback(function(amount) {
        app.writeLog('Currency received: ' + amount);
    });

    Enhance.showOfferwall();
};

Enhance.isOfferwallReady(callback);


Methods:

void Enhance.setReceivedCurrencyCallback(
    onCurrencyReceivedCallback
)

Specify the function which is called every time the user receives a reward from any offerwall. We recommend that you use this function at the beginning of your appâ€™s logic to be sure the callback is ready as soon as an offerwall sends the reward. This could happen at different times, even right after your app starts! As a parameter, this callback will receive an amount of the granted currency (int).
Returns nothing.


void Enhance.isOfferwallReady(

Returns nothing.


Special Offers
--------------

Special offers are real world offers (e.g. surveys). They are available through Enhance ZeroCode, but you can also request them manually from code.


Example Usage:

var callback = function(result) {
    if(!result) {
        app.writeLog('Special offer is not ready');
        return;
    }

    Enhance.showSpecialOffer();
};

Enhance.isSpecialOfferReady(callback);

Analytics
---------

The connector library allows you to send custom events to the hooked analytics networks.


Example Usage:

Enhance.logEvent('game_over', 'level', '2');
Enhance.logEvent('exit');


Methods:

void Enhance.logEvent(
    eventType,
    paramKey,
    paramValue
)

Local Notifications
-------------------

Local Notifications are reminders which show up on your screen after the app becomes inactive for a specific amount of time.


Example Usage:

var onPermissionGranted = function() {
    // Success
    Enhance.enableLocalNotification('Game', 'Play me!', 60);
};

var onPermissionRefused = function() {
    // Failure
};

Enhance.requestLocalNotificationPermission(OnPermissionGranted, OnPermissionRefused);


Methods:

void Enhance.requestLocalNotificationPermission(
    onPermissionGrantedCallback,
    onPermissionRefusedCallback
)

Request a permission from the user to show local notifications. This won't have any effect on Android devices as you don't need a permission to schedule local notifications there (onPermissionGrantedCallback will be still fired).
Returns nothing.


void Enhance.enableLocalNotification(
    title,
    message,
    delaySeconds
)

Schedule a new local notification, if possible. The notification will persist until you disable it manually. For example, if you set a notification for 60 seconds, it will invoke this notification 60 seconds after the app is closed every time.
Returns nothing.


void Enhance.disableLocalNotification()
Disable any local notification that was previously enabled.

        Enhance.purchases.getDisplayTitle('my_product', 'My product', function(result) {
            alert(result);
        });
    };

    var onPurchaseFailed = function() {
        // Failure
    };

    Enhance.purchases.attemptPurchase('my_product', onPurchaseSuccess, onPurchaseFailed);
};

Enhance.purchases.isSupported(callback);
